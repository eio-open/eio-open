# EIO Glasses webOS Demo

Welcome to the **EIO OpenGlassesÂ SDK** â€” an earlyâ€‘access software kit and documentation set for building AR experiences on the Star1s reference hardware (480â€¯Ã—â€¯320 display).

This repository contains a minimal demo web application for EIO Glasses, designed to run on the webOS OSE Emulator.

> **Status:** proofâ€‘ofâ€‘concept, preâ€‘production hardware; APIs and structure will change.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install:

- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Oracle VirtualBox**
- **webOS OSE Emulator** (runs in VirtualBox)
- **webOS CLI tools** (`ares-cli`)

| Feature | Spec                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Display | 480â€¯Ã—â€¯320 monocular screen              |
| OS      | webOSÂ 2.23 (AndroidÂ 9Â AOSP base)      |
| Sensors | Camera, Mic, IMU, Touchpad/KeyEvents |
| I/O     | BT/BLE, Wiâ€‘Fi                        |

This guide covers:
- How to install VirtualBox
- How to download and import the webOS OSE Emulator
- How to install the webOS CLI tools (`ares-cli`)
- How to start and use the emulator

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd eio-open/platforms/webos/hello-eio-glasses-webos
    ```

2. **Package the app:**
    ```bash
    ares-package .
    ```
    This will create a `.ipk` file in the current directory.

3. **Start the webOS Emulator:**
    - Open VirtualBox and start the imported webOS OSE VM.
    - Wait for the emulator to fully boot (you should see the webOS home screen).

4. **Install the app on the emulator:**
    ```bash
    ares-install -d emulator com.eio.demo.glasses_0.0.1_all.ipk
    ```

* Camera preview
* Key event logger
* Voice recording & TTS echo
  *(GIF in /docs/screenshots soon)*

5. **Launch the app:**
    ```bash
    ares-launch -d emulator com.eio.demo.glasses
    ```

## Project Structure

```
platforms/webos/hello-eio-glasses-webos/
â”œâ”€â”€ appinfo.json      # App manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js            # Main JavaScript logic
â”œâ”€â”€ icon.png          # App icon
â””â”€â”€ views/
    â””â”€â”€ MainPanel.jsx # Main view (if using Enact/React)
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you get a connection error (`ECONNREFUSED`), make sure the emulator is running and fully booted.
- If you have issues with packaging, check that all JSX files use the `.jsx` extension.
